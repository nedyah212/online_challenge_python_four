## Challenge
Randomness
Define a function, random number, that takes no parameters. The function must generate a random integer between 1 and 100, both inclusive, and return it.

Calling the function multiple times should (usually) return different numbers.

For example, calling random number() some times might first return 42, then 63, then 1.
